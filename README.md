# Bejeweled

Game to swap jewels around; they disappear when a group of three or more is put together.

The aim is to gain familiarity with the rendering library SDL (https://wiki.libsdl.org/).

If you plan on using the source code you will need to link your code to SDL 2.0 and SDL_image 2.0. 

A very useful tutorial on these libraries can be found here: http://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/
